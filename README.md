## Emails Available for AWS SES
Note that I am using the free tier of AWS SES (and all of the Amazon Services used), there are many restrictions as I wasn't grant to exit the sandbox environment. One of the restriction is emails address of receiver must be verified to successfully send an email to the receiver. To lessen the hustle, I have created a few dummy emails and verified them for testing purposes.

If you wish to use your own email, do let me know so I can add your email addresses for verification.

* dummy.meeting.1@gmail.com |  pwd: Test@123
* dummy.meeting.2@gmail.com |  pwd: Test@123
